# Task grammar

One grammar governs every task line, in a spec's `tasks.md` or a plan's checklist.
The methodology is a property of the task, not of the vehicle that carried it.

```
- [ ] 1.1 (Unit) Parse the manifest file — R1.2, R1.4
- [ ] 1.2 (TDD) Calculate the pro-rata split across accounts — R2.1
```

- `- [ ]` / `- [x]` — the checkbox is the state.
- `1.1` — a unique number, `<group>.<item>`.
- `(Unit)` or `(TDD)` — **required, exactly one.** A task with no methodology is a
  task where nobody decided, which is the failure this practice exists to prevent.
  `scc` exits `2` on a task missing it.
- The description, in the imperative.
- `— R1.2, R1.4` — the requirements this task satisfies, after an em dash. Required in
  a spec's `tasks.md`; that citation is what makes traceability checkable.

There is no parallel-dispatch marker. Implementation is sequential — see
[delivery.md](delivery.md) for why, and for the parallelism that *is* supported.

Requirements are numbered `R<group>.<item>` and cited by that ID: it greps cleanly, it
never collides with a task's own number, and a reader who has never seen this document
can follow it.

## How big is a task

**A task is the right size when it can be verified on its own.** Not "one file", not
"an hour" — verifiable alone, which is what makes the per-task loop in
[verification.md](verification.md) possible at all.

Granularity is not tidiness; it decides what a failure costs. Agents complete
individual steps far more reliably than whole workflows, and structuring work so a
failure can be retried at the subtask level cut retry cost by ~73% against retrying a
whole plan. Too coarse and a red result tells you only that a feature is broken; too
fine and the checklist becomes bookkeeping about work smaller than recording it.

## Two checklists, one truth

Your harness's todo list tracks the task you are on right now. The file —
`specs/<feature>/tasks.md`, or the checklist in `plans/<name>.md` — is the durable
record: it survives the session, it gets reviewed, it gets committed, and it is what
`scc` validates.

**Checking an item off in the session means checking the `- [ ]` box in the file too.**
A session ending with its todo list complete and the file untouched has lost
everything except the code: neither the next session nor the reviewer knows which
tasks were done.
